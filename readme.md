# Mifare DESFire EV3 Masterkey to DES using NFCjLib


## Library used for this app

This app is using the NFCjLib library from **Desfire Tools for Android** available on GitHub here:
https://github.com/skjolber/desfire-tools-for-android.

It was written by Thomas Skj√∏lberg ("skjolber") and this one is the best available source for accessing 
NXP's Mifare DESFire tags. 

About the license situation: The library itself has no dedicated license information but the library is a combination of 2 sub 
libraries with own licenses:
- nfcjlib - [Modified BSD License (3-clause BSD)](https://github.com/skjolber/desfire-tools-for-android/blob/master/nfcjlib/LICENSE)
- libfreefare - [LGPL 3.0 with classpath exception](https://github.com/skjolber/desfire-tools-for-android/blob/master/libfreefare/LICENSE)

## Background informtion

If you are trying to get basic information's about the DESFire tag the first contact point is the manufacturer's datasheet, available here:
- DESFire EV1 MF3ICDX21_41_81_SDS: https://www.nxp.com/docs/en/data-sheet/MF3ICDX21_41_81_SDS.pdf
- DESFire EV2 MF3DX2_MF3DHX2_SDS: https://www.nxp.com/docs/en/data-sheet/MF3DX2_MF3DHX2_SDS.pdf
- DESFire EV3 MF3D(H)x3: https://www.nxp.com/docs/en/data-sheet/MF3DHx3_SDS.pdf
- DESFire EV3 Quick start guide: https://www.nxp.com/docs/en/application-note/AN12753.pdf
- DESFire EV3 feature and functionality comparison to other MIFARE DESFire products: https://www.nxp.com/docs/en/application-note/AN12752.pdf

Unfortunately the 3 main datasheets are shortened by the manufacturer and the full datasheets are available under **Non disclosure agreements (NDA)** only - 
the agreement is not available for private persons.

So the only chance is to use the **datasheet for the first version of DESFire tags ("D40")** using this link:
https://neteril.org/files/M075031_desfire.pdf.

Another fine piece of information is the **NXP MIFARE DESFire EV1 Protocol** available here: https://github.com/revk/DESFireAES/blob/master/DESFire.pdf. 
This is a short overview about most of the DESFire EV1 commands and error codes.

## About this app: 
It is developed using Android Studio version Giraffe | 2022.3.1 Patch 1 and is running on SDK 21 to 33 (Android 13) (tested on 
Android 8 and 13 with real devices).  

The only purpose of the app is to change the **Master Application Key** from a default AES key to a default DES key..

The default AES key is 16 bytes long and filled with 16 0x00 values, the default DES key is filled with 8 * 0x00 values.

```plaintext
default AES-Key: 00000000000000000000000000000000
default DES-Key: 0000000000000000
```
The key is **changed immediately after tapping** the tag to the NFC reader, so be careful if you realy want to change the key.
